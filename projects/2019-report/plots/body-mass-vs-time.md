Most of this data comes from a eufy smart scale. It was sitting in a box for most of the middle of the year, hence the large gap in the data.

At the beginning of November my weight hit 200 lbs., which is a large enough round number that I was like "damn, I should think about what I eat". This was remarkably effective until the holidays.
