All of these plots are interactive if you click the page for a given plot - you can zoom and scroll around.

*January 2019*: Round one of this report is the "raw data" plots that are up on this page. I haven't drawn any very interesting conclusions or mapped out correlations yet.

Next steps: clean up the data from the beginning of the year and put together some correlation plots.

If this is interesting, please [tell me](http://twitter.com/aaronbeekay) â€“ it's a great motivator for me to keep hacking at this.
