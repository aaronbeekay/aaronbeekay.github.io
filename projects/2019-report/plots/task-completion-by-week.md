The [tagged task performance](tagged-task-performance-by-week.html) plot shows my performance on the to-do items I laid out at the beginning of each week, but there are plenty of tasks I do that aren't on that list. Things that come up during the course of the week, or things that I do spontaneously instead of doing something from my list, aren't a part of the tagged tasks.

This plot shows the total number of to-do items I completed each week (tagged and untagged). There are variations in the number of tasks I complete when I do good planning, but it also shows that some weeks I was completely off my system and didn't use my to-do manager at all.
