Here's a pretty good one: the number of hours that I tagged "nap" in my timesheet.

Here's the definition of the "nap" tag: 

<blockquote class="blockquote"><ul><li>Sleeping that happens after the first wake of the day (when I get out of bed from the previous nightâ€™s sleep), and after the daily wake time (8am)</li><li>Not: oversleeping</li></ul></blockquote>

Like in the [traveling time](traveling-hours-per-day.html) plot, the blue trace is the raw data, and the red trace is a 7-day moving average.

The moving average looks periodic, and I don't understand why. FWIW, I thought it might be an artifact of outliers, so I switched the moving average to a moving median - but the same trend shows up.
