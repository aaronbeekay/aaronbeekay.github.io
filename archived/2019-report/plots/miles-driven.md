Here are my daily miles driven, from fuel-up logs of my vehicles. The data intervals are weird because some vehicles are filled up infrequently or irregularly - this plot shows the average miles driven per day, based on the number of miles in the last tank and the days since the last fill-up.

I only bought the Tracker at the end of 2019, so it doesn't show up earlier than Nov.

I don't track fuel-ups on my motorcycles, so some around-town miles on the DR650 over the summer don't show up here.
