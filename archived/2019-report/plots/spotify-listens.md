Just for fun, here's my Spotify listening activity over time. Darker squares indicate I listened to more songs in that interval.

This data is pulled from the archive Spotify gives you in response to a GPDR request - unfortunately, it looks like they only save data for one year back, so if you want to build a big database of your own listening, you might want to do this every 9 months or something.

I also listen to Apple Music (sometimes) and SoundCloud/radio/other mixes (less often), but I think the majority of my activity is on Spotify.

This dataset is filtered to include only song plays longer than ten seconds (to exclude songs I skipped from the counts).

Like in the [messaging activity plot](messaging-activity-histogram.md), you can see pretty clearly when I get a job at the end of October.
