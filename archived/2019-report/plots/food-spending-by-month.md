Here's a breakdown of my total expenditures on food for each month of the year. The y-axis is USD spent.

Near the end of the year, I went a little wild and imported all of my transaction data for all of my credit cards and bank accounts into a double-entry accounting software ([GnuCash](https://gnucash.org)). The categories here should be pretty accurate.

In October or so, I started to save receipts for grocery trips and break out the spend cost by category (so, for example, a $100 grocery run that included $20 for a case of beer would show up as $20 Alcohol and $80 Groceries, instead of $100 Groceries). The Groceries category might contain a little bit of Alcohol spending for months before that.

This does not include alcohol purchased at bars or events - but that spending isn't very much compared to these amounts.
