Starting in August, I logged an optional _project_ each activity is associated with, in addition to category tags.

There are a lot of projects, so this plot just shows the top three projects, by hours logged, for each week. Other projects logged that week, if there are any, aren't shown at all.

I think there are better ways of categorizing and visualizing these projects, but this plot is kinda fun as is.

NB: Some projects ("Feeding myself", "Personal medical") got created later in the year, which is why "Feeding myself" only starts to show up in October, for instance. Eventually I hope to go back through the year's data and re-tag/re-categorize activities.
