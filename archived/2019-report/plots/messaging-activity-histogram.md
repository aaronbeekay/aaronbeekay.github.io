Here is my text message (iMessage + SMS) activity, by time of day, for all of 2019. Darker squares indicate I sent more messages.

This data is pulled from the `chat.db` database kept by the Messages app on macOS, which I have been hanging onto for a few years now. The plot density shows only messages sent by me (the histogram for received messages looks about the same).

The times on the y-axis are EST, and they aren't corrected for any traveling I did to different time zones. For the most part I stayed in EST in 2019, though.

Neat things you can see in this plot:

- the week I went to Cuba (just before May)
- the effect of me getting a day job (end of October) - my texting activity drops off sharply, especially during business hours
- Something that changed around April (?) where my texting activity between ~3pm-9pm drops off sharply
