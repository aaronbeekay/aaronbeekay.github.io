Every week, I pick a list of tasks I want to get done that week, and I flag them in my to-do application. These tasks aren't as big as weekly goals, but they're still things on my plate.

I don't do this perfectly consistently, so many weeks are missing. The bottom bar in each week represents the tasks I completed, and the top bar represents the tasks that were still outstanding at the end of the week.

Roughly speaking, the total height of each bar is the scale of my weekly plan (how big a bite I took), and the bottom bar is how well I did at it (how much I could chew).
