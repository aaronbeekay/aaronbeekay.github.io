Starting in May, I recorded a daily mood score at the end of each day, usually right before I went to bed.

Mood ends up being a very different thing to quantify, and unfortunately I don't have any kind of hard index to pin these values to. The score ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst possible feeling imaginable and 10 is the best feeling possible. Obviously, these are pretty subjective.

I don't trust this data very much, but collecting it seemed better than nothing. This is one of the things I hope to improve in 2020.

As with other time plots, light blue data is raw/daily values, the red trace is a 7-day moving average.
